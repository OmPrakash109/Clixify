After implementing security part that we did through packages:
            - models
            - repository/UserRepository
            - service/UserDetailsImpl
            - service/UserDetailsServiceImpl
            - security/jwt classes
            - security/WebSecurityConfig

We will work on 'register' endpoint which would allow user to register into our application.
For this, we would be creating:
        - set of controllers
        - service which would handle request from controller and manage the authentication
        - we also need user models that we have already created

For Controller, for methods like POST, we would be fetching data from frontend, and for capturing the data, we create DTOs.
DTO(Data Transfer Object) is a simple object used to transfer data between layers (e.g. Controller -> Service -> Repository) or between different applications.
We use DTO instead of using entity directly in our controller, because we don't want to expose our database structure to the outside world.
