After implementing, security part that we did through packages:
            - models
            - repository/UserRepository
            - service/UserDetialsImpl
            - service/UserDetialsServiceImpl
            - security/jwt classes
            - security/WebSecurityConfig

We will work on 'register' endpoint which would allow user to register into our application.
For this, we would be creating:
        - set of controllers
        - service which would handle request from controller and manage the authentication
        - we also need user models that we have already configured

For Controller, for methods like POST, we would be fetching data from frontend, and for capturing the data, we create DTOs
