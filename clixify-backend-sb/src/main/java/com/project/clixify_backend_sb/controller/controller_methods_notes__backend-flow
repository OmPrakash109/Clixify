After implementing security part that we did through packages:
            - models
            - repository/UserRepository
            - service/UserDetailsImpl
            - service/UserDetailsServiceImpl
            - security/jwt classes
            - security/WebSecurityConfig

Endpoints: ------------------------------------

1. register

We will work on 'register' endpoint which would allow user to register into our application.
For this, we would be creating:
        - controller method 'registerUser' which would handle the request from frontend (by using RegisterRequest DTO) for user registration and forward it to service layer with the help of UserService that we inject
        - service method 'registerUser' which would handle request from controller and have the business logic for user registration
        - In service method, we would be using repository method 'save' to save the user in database by injecting UserRepository interface


For Controller, for methods like POST, we would be fetching data from frontend, and for capturing the data, we create DTOs.
DTO(Data Transfer Object) is a simple object used to transfer data between layers (e.g. Controller -> Service -> Repository) or between different applications.
We use DTO instead of using entity directly in our controller, because we don't want to expose our database structure to the outside world.


2. login

After implementing register endpoint, we will implement login endpoint which would allow user to login into our application using username and password, and after successful login, it would generate a token for the user that would be used for authentication in future requests.
For this, we would be creating:
        - controller method 'authenticateUser' which would handle the request from frontend (by using LoginRequest DTO) for user login and forward it to service layer with the help of UserService that we inject
        - service method 'authenticateUser' which would handle request from controller and have the business logic for user login and generate a token for the user by using JwtUtils class and return the token as response


3. generate short URL

After implementing login endpoint, we will implement generate short URL endpoint which would allow user to generate a short URL for their original URL.
For this, we would be creating:
        - controller method 'createShortUrl' in `UrlMappingController` which would handle the POST request from frontend (by using Map<String, String> for request body) for generating short URL and forward it to service layer with the help of UrlMappingService that we inject
        - service method 'createShortUrl' in `UrlMappingService` which would handle request from controller and have the business logic for generating short URL and return the `UrlMappingDTO` as response
        - In service method, we would be using repository method 'save' to save the short URL in database by injecting UrlMappingRepository interface


4. get all URLs mapped/associated with the user(principal) who made the request
After implementing generate short URL endpoint, we will implement get all URLs mapped/associated with the user(principal) who made the request endpoint which would allow user to get all the URLs mapped/associated with the user(principal) who made the request.
For this, we would be creating:
        - controller method 'getUserUrls' in `UrlMappingController` which would handle the GET request from frontend (by using Principal to get the authenticated user) for getting all the URLs mapped/associated with the user who made the request and forward it to service layer with the help of UrlMappingService that we inject
        - service method 'getUrlsByUser' in `UrlMappingService` which would handle request from controller and have the business logic for getting all the URLs mapped/associated with the user by using repository method 'findByUser' to get all the URLs from database and then convert each UrlMapping to UrlMappingDTO and return the `List<UrlMappingDTO>` as response
        - repository method 'findByUser' in `UrlMappingRepository` which would be automatically implemented by Spring Data JPA to find all UrlMappings associated with the given user




Now that we have implemented endpoints for user registration, login, URL shortening, and URL retrieval, we will work on 'Analytics' part where we would implement 2 endpoints which would allow user to get analytics of their URLs.

1. First Endpoint:

GET /analytics/abc123?startDate=2024-12-01T00:00:00&endDate=2024-12-15-07T23:59:59

In above line: /analytics = endpoint and abc123 = shortUrl
This helps to get the analytics (click count by date) for a particular short URL by date, within a particular date range(that we pass as parameter)
[
    {
        "clickData": "2024-12-01",
        "count": 10
    },
    {
        "clickDate": "2024-12-02",
        "count": 20
    }
]


2. Second Endpoint

GET /totalclicks?startDate=2024-12-01&endDate=2024-12-15

{
    "2024-12-01": 15,
    "2024-12-02": 20
}

In above line: /totalclicks = endpoint

This gives total clicks of all the URLs that user owns or has created(thats why we did not pass any specific URL), within a particular date range.(that we pass as parameter)
