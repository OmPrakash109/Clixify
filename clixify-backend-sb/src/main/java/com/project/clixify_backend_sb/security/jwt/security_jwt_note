'security' package stores all the classes related to Security like:

* JwtUtils (service layer for JwtAuthenticationFilter) -> This class contains utility helper methods for:
           - Generating a token with User details
           - Extracting token from authentication header and also Extract username from JWT token (parsing the token)
           - Validating the token

* JwtAuthenticationFilter -> This class Filters the incoming request to check the validity of the token for each request (as it extends the OncePerRequestFilter class)
    There are mainly 4 steps in this class:
     //Step 1: Extract/get JWT Token From the Authorization Header of the incoming Request
     //Step 2: If there is token, Validate the JWT Token
     //Step 3: If token is Valid, extract/get username from it and load corresponding User Details from database using UserDetailsService.
     //Step 4: Set the Authentication in the Security Context Holder (by getting object of 'UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken' by passing the 'userDetails' and 'null' as credentials)
     //Step 5: Continue the filter chain

     - Step 1 to Step 4 lies inside try block, and Step 5 lies after try-catch block.
     - Step 3 and Step 4 lies inside the Step 2.


* JwtAuthenticationResponse -> This is a DTO(Data Transfer Object) class which represents the  JWT authentication response.
                                - It defines the way in which the Authentication Response is displayed to the User.
